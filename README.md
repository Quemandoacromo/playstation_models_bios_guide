* **DEVELOPER ONLY**.
  - **DTL-H2000** - is not a console, but a special "developer board" - an addon developer inserts in his PC to write and debug PS games. it was, essentially, a Playstation bundled in form of PC board with 8 MB instead of 2MB. only licensed developers had access to it. it was released *in January, 1994*, long before any retail Playstation were released

* **FIRST GENERATION**. motherboard PU-7. Rev. A of GPU, has S-Video, 
  - **SCPH-1000** :jp: - original Japanese console, *released on 03 December 1994*.
  - **DTL-H1000** :jp: - Japanese blue-colored debugger. region lockup (for some odd reasons). all debuggers have the same 2MB RAM as regular consoles, information saying about having 8MB is wrong.
  - **DTL-H1001** :us: - North American blue-colored debugger. no regional lockup.
  - **DTL-H1002** :uk: - European blue-colored debugger. no regional lockup.
  - **DTL-H1000H** :jp: - same as DTL-H1000 but has gray-colored case and updated BIOS. used in display kiosk on events like E3 (they thought that using blue-colored debuggers on E3 will create false assumption that retail console will be of blue color, so they used gray-colored debugger to not confuse journalists and gamers).
  - **DTL-H1001H** :us: - same as DTL-H1001 but has gray-colored case. display kiosk as above.
  - **DTL-H1002H** :question: - it is quite possible this console exist, but so far nobody have seen one. high chances that this console does not exist, because there were no major game convention in Europe.

* **SECOND GENERATION**. motherboard PU-8. Rev. B of GPU (bug fixes in libraries), has no S-Video, 
  - **SCPH-3000** :jp: - Japanese version, *released on 21 July 1995*.
  - **SCPH-1001** :us: - original North American console, *released on 09 September 1995*. despite being named SCPH-1001, that console is based on SCPH-3000, not SCPH-1000, Sony used odd numeration here.
  - **SCPH-1002** :uk: - original European console, *released on 29 September 1995*. again, based on SCPH-3000, not SCPH-1000.
  - ~~**SCPH-1003**~~  :exclamation: - **DOES NOT EXIST**. there were rumors that Sony released Playstation in Southeast Asian region alongside SCPH-1001 & SCPH-1002, but it is false. the very first console released in this region were SCPH-5003 / SCPH-5903 (gray import was available, though).

* **THIRD GENERATION**. motherboard PU-8. changes in CPU (on the part of GTE). 
  - **SCPH-3500** :jp: - Japanese version, *released on 28 March 1996*. 
  - *2nd revision* of **SCPH-1001** :us: / **SCPH-1002** :uk: - Sony released updated versions of SCPH-1001/SCPH-1002 without altering the numeration. people sometimes referring them as SCPH-1001B/SCPH-1002B to tell the difference from the second generation.
  - **DTL-H1100** :jp: - Japanese blue-colored debugger. it has a unique BIOS that is not available on any retail consoles.
  - **DTL-H1101** :us: - North American blue-colored debugger.
  - **DTL-H1102** :uk: - European blue-colored debugger.
  - ~~**SCPH-2000**~~  :exclamation: - **DOES NOT EXIST**. some sites refer it as "all-region PS", but it is hoax, probably people confusing SCPH-2000 and DTL-H1000. "SCPH-2000" is, btw, the name of prototype adapter for never-released Playstation keyboard. most probably, Sony thought about giving to console a Net-addon, but scrapped that idea.

* **FOURTH GENERATION**. motherboard PU-8. Rev. C of GPU (GPU uses SGRAM now).
  - **SCPH-5000** :jp: - Japanese version, *released on 22 June 1996*.
  - *3rd revision* of **SCPH-1001** :us: / **SCPH-1002** :uk: - Sony revised their SCPH-1001/SCPH-1002, but didn't change the names again. people refer them as SCPH-1001C and SCPH-1002C.
  - **SCPH-5003**  :earth_asia: - original Southeast Asian console. weirdly, the numeration follows SCPH-5000, but console features the SCPH-1001C's BIOS (in English). people assumed it did not exist, but it is mentioned in a manual for SCPH-103.
  - **SCPH-5903** :earth_asia: - special Southeast Asian console with Video CD support. that version has separated japan-based BIOS.
  - **DTL-H1200** :jp: - Japanese green-colored debugger.
  - **DTL-H1201** :us: - North American green-colored debugger.
  - **DTL-H1202** :uk: - European green-colored debugger.
  - **DTL-H3000** :jp: - Japanese black-colored Net Yaroze.
  - **DTL-H3001** :us: - North American black-colored Net Yaroze.
  - **DTL-H3002** :uk: - European black-colored Net Yaroze.

* **FIFTH GENERATION**. motherboard PU-18. relocation and improvements in CD-ROM drive. A/V direct out and RFU power connector removed. motherboard PCB reduced in size.
  - **SCPH-5500** :jp: - Japanese version, *released on 15 November 1996*.
  - **SCPH-5001** / **SCPH-5501** :us: - North American SCPH-5500. they differ in supplies: SCPH-5001 has one controller, SCPH-5501 has two controllers and a memory card. for long time people thought that SCPH-5001 does not exist, but is mentioned in a manual to SCPH-101 (alongside SCPH-5501).
  - **SCPH-5502** / **SCPH-5552** :uk: - European SCPH-5500. same as above, differ in supplies. there is a false information that SCPH-5502 is a regular European console and SCPH-5552 is a rare promo-console for "Man in Black" movie. while it is true that "Man in Black"-based console Playstation indeed was released - there also were the regular gray-colored versions of SCPH-5552.
  - **SCPH-5503** :earth_asia: - Southeast Asian SCPH-5500.
  - ~~**SCPH-5002**~~  :exclamation: - **DOES NOT EXIST**. it seems weird at first glance, because SCPH-5000 (Japanese fourth generation), SCPH-5001 (American fifth generation), SCPH-5003 (Southeast Asian fourth generation) do all exist, but not SCPH-5002, but it is fact. blame Sony for the confusing numeration. even if it would have existed it would be a third(!) European counterpart in fifth generation (together with SCPH-5502 and SCPH-5552) which is too much.

* **SIXTH GENERATION**. motherboard PU-20. DualShock & Sound Scope support. different video encoder. CD circuits simplified. memory changed from 4 chips to 1.
  - **SCPH-7000** :jp: - Japanese version, *released on 13 November 1997*.
  - **SCPH-7001** :us: - North American SCPH-7000.
  - **SCPH-7002** :uk: - European SCPH-7000.
  - **SCPH-7003** :earth_asia: - Southeast Asian SCPH-7000. oddly, but is has down-leveled BIOS against SCPH-7000 (3.0 instead of 4.0).
  - **SCPH-7000W** :jp: - the special Japanese blue-colored console, released to celebrate of 10 millionth sold unit. obviously, based on SCPH-7000, but has English BIOS and no regional lockup. known as "*Midnight Blue*".

* **SEVENTH GENERATION**. motherboard PU-22. reductions in electronics and hardware.
  - **SCPH-7500** :jp: - Japanese version, *released on 01 December 1998*. 
  - **SCPH-7501** :us: - North American SCPH-7500.
  - **SCPH-7502** :uk: - European SCPH-7500.
  - **SCPH-7503** :earth_asia: - Southeast Asian SCPH-7500. compare to SCPH-7003 it now has a modern BIOS.
  - **SCPH-9903** :us: - weird console released in North America. it is basically the SCPH-7501, but where an original console can operate on 120V only, the SCPH-9903 can handle 240V. sticker on the back says console was released in May 1999, but it still qualifies as seventh generation because of hardware.

* **EIGHT GENERATION**. motherboard PU-23. more motherboard reductions, removal of parallel I/O port.
  - **SCPH-9000** :jp: - Japanese version, *released on 28 May 1999*.
  - **SCPH-9001** :us: - North American SCPH-9000.
  - **SCPH-9002** :uk: - European SCPH-9000.
  - **SCPH-9003** :earth_asia: - Southeast Asian SCPH-9000.

* **NINTH GENERATION** (aka PSone). the size of console was dramatically reduced, removal of serial port.
  - **SCPH-100** :jp: - Japanese version, *released on 07 July 2000*. 
  - **SCPH-101** :us: - North American SCPH-100, *released on 19 September 2000*. 
  - **SCPH-102** :uk: - European SCPH-100, *released on 29 September 2000*. 
  - *2nd revision* of **SCPH-101** :us: / **SCPH-102** :uk: - as with SCPH-1001/SCPH-1002 at the beginning of lifespan, Sony released the revised version of console without naming them differently - no hardware difference, just revamped BIOS.
  - **SCPH-103** :earth_asia: - Southeast Asian SCPH-100. sources says it has better BIOS (4.6) than American analogue (4.4 / 4.5) - it is false, its BIOS matches 2nd revision of SCPH-102.
  - **SCPH-102A** / **SCPH-102B** / **SCPH-102C** :exclamation: - people believe that there are three different versions of SCPH-102 differ on their hardware or BIOS. in fact all those versions differ in packages and supplies only: SCPH-102A has AV cable & AC adapter, SCPH-102B has RFU adapter & AC adapter, SCPH-102C has AV cable, AC adapter and Euro-Scart-adapter. Also manuals for SCPH-102A/SCPH-102B are English only, while SCPH-102C is present in six European languages.
